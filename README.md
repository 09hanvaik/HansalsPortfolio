# Hansal's Portfolio

## Description

This project is to display my work to potential employers and colleagues.
The requirements (in the form of Acs) to make this first draft are being taken directly from EdX FE Bootcamp second challenge's description. 
The HTML and CSS have been adapted from the first challenge's file but optimised to be responsive by me.


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
