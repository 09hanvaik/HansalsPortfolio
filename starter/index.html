            <h2>My First Project</h2>
            <p>
                The first challenge included taking a page similar to this and fixing the HTML and CSS. Additional I marked up the files, learned good use of git and version control and publishing on a github site.

            <p>
                I am fairly good at chess. I particularly enjoy bullet chess - it is a very fast mode of the game where each oponent gets 1 min on their clock!

            <p>
                I used to play hockey quite a lot. Now that I am ancient at 26, not so much. However I would love to get back on it.

            <p>
                Running is fun! I do 10km run sometimes but I am pretty much dead by the end of it always.
